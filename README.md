### **In this project:**

1. **we took a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset/code">Kaggle</a> dealing with Disease Symptom Prediction.**

2. **Then we trained a decision tree classifier on it.**

3. **Later we deployed it in an web based application.**

4. **As of now you can run the total web app(both frontend and backend) in your localhost.**
